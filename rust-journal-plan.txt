    - [done] On startup, the program must ask the user for the name of a new journal, if none are present.
        -[done]  else it must ask the user to show a particular journal.
            - this is so that if we are screen-recording or something, we are less likely to accidentally show private entries.
        -[done]  inputting "set j(ournal)? <journal_name> or set 0" must be able to change the current journal name
        -> inputting "new j(ournal)? <journal_name> must create a new journal.
            - we need to add journal at the end, because what if we want to write about this new thing that we just got?
                like: "new strategy:"
                    it is 
            - and the reason why we don't want to preface commands with / or similar is because we will forget to add it and write unwanted stuff into the journal

- Reading and writing to a journal. Requirements:
    Writing requirements:
        - Each entry is a block. A block consists of several lines.
            The first line isn't indented, but the following are.
            The final line is empty, and marks the beginning of a new block.
            Each line is timestamped
        
        - [done] inputting "some text" must append to the current block
        - [done] inputting "-some text" must create a new block
        - [done] inputting "~" must toggle the last line from being a new block and being the last block

        - [done] each line must have the current timestamp.
            - [done I think] If I try to write to a journal I still have open from a previous day, the program must create a new journal automatically

    Reading requirements:
        - [done] Each entry must contain the journal name, the date, and the name of the day. 
        - [ongoing] I must be able to open the journal in notepad, and see exactly the same thing
        -> inputting "last 5" must read the last 5 entries, and stitch them together
            - inputting "last 5 2" must read from entry HEAD~5 to HEAD~10 and stitch them together
        -> inputting "time" or "times" must parse all of the timestamps for each line, and print statistics about time usage.


    Other Command requirements:
        - inputting any command must not result in writing to the journal, and instead output stats of some kind, or other non-destructive action.
