# Rust journal
A rewrite of my python journal, but in rust. 
It only has the features that I actually use, and while the code is similarly unreadable, it has a much better structure.
It has the added bonus that you don't need python to be able to run it.
You can compile it and run it, or just grab the .exe from the releases tab. More instructions are found within the program itself, and it has a /help command with more documentation, so I won't write any here.

I tried to do this a few months ago, but I just couldn't wrap my head around rust's type system, particularly the differences between the String and &str and OsString and OsStr classes. But recently, the Rust VS-Code extension seems to have had an update that will intrusively insert the the auto-deduced type at all times, and I believe this helped me understand it a lot better. I used to hate this language, but now that I am able to actually use it, I think it's pretty good. Funny how that works, isn't it?
